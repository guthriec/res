# Documentation

This repository keeps long-form documentation in `docs/`.

## Structure

- `docs/cli/` — CLI user documentation
  - `README.md` — overview, install, and quickstart
  - `commands.md` — complete command and option reference
  - `examples.md` — practical command recipes

## Scope

For now, the docs are focused on the CLI surface. As library/API docs are added, they should live under `docs/library/`.
